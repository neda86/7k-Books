# 7k-Books
This dataset offers various applications, including conducting Exploratory Data Analysis, clustering books based on their topics or categories, and building a content-based recommendation system using different aspects of a book's description. It's smaller than Soumik's Goodreads-books dataset because many ISBNs from that collection did not yield valid results when queried through the Google Books API. There are plans to expand this dataset in the future by utilizing additional fields like title and author in the API requests. The dataset was constructed using a tool called Google Books Crawler. It's important to acknowledge that this dataset was significantly influenced by and reliant on Soumik's Goodreads-books dataset.
